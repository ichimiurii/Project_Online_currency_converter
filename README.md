# Software development for Online Currency Converter


Software for **Online Currency Converter** is experiencing a moment of great interest and growth in the world.  But it is still difficult to find a software that is able to combine all the features needed for managing the entire lifecycle of a Currencies in an integrated and intuitive manner.



The purpose of this project is to develop an online application that allows to convert currencies, without the need to install any software locally. The project therefore aims to develop a **modular Web application** that allows:

- **Assisted formulation of currency converter**
- **Printing Currency Converter**
- **Data management (amount, source currency to convert , destination currency to convert, reference date for the exchange rate, ...)**
- **...**


The application is called **Online Currency Converter**. The project has already started and the general structure of the application is a client-server application in which the server exposes a set of APIs for data management (following the REST style and implemented in JavaScript / [node.js](https://nodejs.org)) and the client is directed to the end user, taking advantage of the back-end APIs. The client is a single-page component application using  [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).



The Online Currency Converter is also a playground for the development of applications based on modern web technologies oriented to all those motivated **Students** who wish to deepen their knowledge on the Web by practice and the implementation of the real functions, various productivity tools, the social network, etc.,  that is contributing to the project and **hopefully in the end get a job :)))))))**
I'm a student at the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).


# What I use for the project:
- **Programming**
- **Wanted to use Databases but used just a xml file**
- **Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nodejs)**
- **So much motivation**

# What I learn in the project:
- **Web technologies (if not already known)**
- **Development / use of REST web services**
- **Application development from services accessible via the Web**
- **Node.js**
- **Design APIs Directly in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)**
- **Documentation with [Swagger](https://swagger.io)**
- **And of course how to Convert Currencies.**



The purpose of this document is to describe the structure and general operating logic of the Online Currency Converter application, its architecture, the main components and the most important technologies used in the implementation. This documentation is intended as a central aggregator of all the information necessary to become familiar with the project.


**Attention**: as Online Currency Convertor is a constantly evolving project, this documentation should also be continuously updated to always represent the latest state of the works.
